      The third iteration of our bike, nicknamed Priscilla, is currently under
      development. In manufacturing, we have added wheel skirts, wells, and
      wheel covers to optimise each wheel rotation. The fairing has been updated
      to a more aerodynamic shape that is made of Carbon Fibre and Kevlar Shell.
      Our new Integration Latch method allows us to lock our roof and base
      fairings together from both inside and out. Our wireless sensors allow us
      to communicate with the central DAS, a network of antenna nodes connected
      to the bike. The Vision System Bit has also been optimised for a better
      field of view and aerodynamics. The DAS communicates with both the Vision
      System Bit and the rest of the team back at the chase car.  Due to the
      coronavirus pandemic, we have been forced to pause manufacturing. However,
      we are using this time to refine our designs, research, and train, while
      we eagerly anticipate returning to the workshop.
