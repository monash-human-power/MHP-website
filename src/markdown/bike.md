  - name: Wombat
    version: 2
    description: "Version 2 of our bike is called Wombat. The significance of Wombat
      lies in design process, where the integration of each subsystem was
      considered holistically for the first time. In this version, there was a
      clear relationship between each component of the bike, which lead to a
      better understanding of the function and contribution of each component. "

    description: "Blacksmith was originally built by a team of final year
      engineering students for their Final Year Project at Monash University.
      This formed Version 1 of the bike and the foundation of MHP. In order for
      Blacksmith to be competitive, its design was further revised for better
      performance and to address safety requirements. The completed design –
      incorporating the modifications made from Version 1 – is referred to as
      Version 1.5. "
