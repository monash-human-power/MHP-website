    description: Monash Human Power Team is proud to offer a robust schools program that is tailored to the inquiry skills of the Victorian Curriculum. We hope to foster the same love for STEM and sustainability that we experienced when we were in school in your students in hopes of inspiring them to pursue it in their tertiary education too. We also help schools competing in the Victorian HPV Super series use the wind tunnel for testing and provide workshop tours.
