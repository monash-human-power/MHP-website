  - heading: Our Mission
    description: Our team is aiming to break the Australian HPV F200 land speed
      record of 94.6km/h. This year marks our largest recruitment to date,
      bringing our team up to 60 interdisciplinary students. We take pride in
      developing industry-ready graduates through our collaborative design and
      manufacturing process. We believe that HPV provides a relevant and
      immersive framework for learning STEM and we use this framework to promote
      sustainability in schools.
