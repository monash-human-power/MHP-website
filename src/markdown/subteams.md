subteams:
  - name: aerodynamics
    description: The Aerodynamics subteam at MHP is chiefly responsible for the
      design and testing of the aerodynamic components of our bike, such as the
      outer shell and wheel covers. The key purpose of the external shell
      (referred to as the 'fairing') is to reduce drag on the bike. This means
      that the fairing is designed to optimise the airflow to increase the speed
      that the bike is going at. Through the use of computational fluid dynamics
      (CFD), as well as experimental testing in the Monash Wind Tunnel, the team
      is able to make aerodynamic design choices that can have a significant
      impact on the performance of the bike in the field.

  - name: chassis & drive-train
    description: "The Chassis & Drive-Train subteam is responsible for the design
      and manufacture of all mechanical components on the vehicle. This includes
      the frame or skeleton and the moving parts of the vehicle. The design
      process involves modelling components through the use of CAD software and
      then verifying that they are capable of withstanding the relevant loading
      through testing on FEA software, or through hand calculations. The
      sub-team utilises the resources available at the university to create the
      components, through manufacturing techniques such as welding, grinding,
      drilling and turning. "

  - name: corporate
    description: "The Corporate sub-team identify and engage the relevant external
      stakeholders to bring efficiency and cohesion to MHP's operations. This
      includes our flagship 'Build an HPV' school outreach program which
      promotes STEM and sustainable transport through the framework of HPV. They
      support the technical side by coordinating sponsorship, events, and
      marketing. "

  - name: electrical
    description: The Electrical sub-team handles both the electrical and software
      aspects of the bike. There are no windows on our fairing, so the rider
      relies on this sub-team for vision. They design the camera and data
      acquisition system to improve the rider's safety and performance. The
      systems consist of Raspberry Pis, microcontrollers, and a network of
      sensors. They also create custom software to view and analyse data from
      field testing and control different systems on the bike.

  - name: materials
    description: The primary purpose of the Materials sub-team is to prototype and
      manufacture the fairing that covers the human-powered bike. This includes
      undergoing a design process to test and optimise the quality of the
      fairing to ensure the aerodynamic performance of the bike and rider
      safety. The fairing is currently fabricated using the resin infusion
      technique which injects epoxy resin into carbon fibre while under a vacuum
      seal. Once the infusion process is complete, the carbon fibre is either
      painted or coated in clear lacquer and decals are applied. The team itself
      provides all members with hands-on manufacturing experience which includes
      but is not limited to creating composite components, the use of power
      tools and surface finishing.

  - name: rider development
    description: The Rider Development sub-team focuses on maximising rider output.
      Their tasks include cycling and strength training for the riders,
      competency training to ride the recumbent bikes, rider power plans for
      maximising speed, and physically testing the mechanical and electrical
      systems of the bike. The Rider Development sub-team is also in charge of
      running event testing days at the Holden and Ford Proving Grounds.
