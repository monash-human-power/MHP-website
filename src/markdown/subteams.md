  - name: Rider Development
    description: "The Rider Development subteam focuses on maximising the
      performance of the rider. Composed of both riders and technical members,
      this subteam arranges cycling and strength training for the riders and
      constructs personal rider power plans. They organise competency training
      to ride the recumbent bikes and physically test its mechanical and
      electrical systems. The Rider Development subteam is also in charge of
      organising and coordinating testing days at the Holden and Ford Proving
      Grounds."

  - name: Aerodynamics
    description: The Aerodynamics subteam at MHP is chiefly responsible for the
      design and testing of the aerodynamic components of the bike, such as the
      external shell and wheel covers. The key purpose of the external shell
      (also referred to as the 'fairing') is to reduce drag on the bike. This
      means that it is designed to optimise the airflow to increase the maximum
      speed that the bike can reach. Through the use of computational fluid
      dynamics (CFD), as well as experimental testing in the Monash Wind Tunnel,
      the team is able to make aerodynamic design choices that can significantly
      improve the performance of the bike.

  - name: Chassis & Drive-train
    description:
      The Chassis & Drive-train subteam is responsible for the design and
      manufacture of all mechanical components on the vehicle. This includes the
      structural frame (referred to as the chassis) and the moving parts of the
      vehicle. The design process involves modelling components through the use
      of CAD software, and then verifying that they are capable of withstanding
      the relevant loading through testing on FEA software or through hand
      calculations. The subteam utilises the resources available at Monash
      University to create the components, using manufacturing techniques such
      as welding, grinding, drilling and turning.

  - name: Operations
    description: The Operations subteam identifies and engages
      external stakeholders to effectively facilitate the operations of MHP. This includes coordinating with sponsors
      and marketing MHP activities. They are also in charge of organising events to promote the missions of MHP, such as
      our flagship 'Build a HPV' school outreach program which encourages STEM pathways and educates students on
      sustainable transport. The Operations subteam also provides support to the technical side of MHP and their
      endeavours to efficiently manufacture the bike. Members of the operations subteam are also highly involved in
      the graphic design and branding of MHP.

  - name: Electrical
    description: The Electrical subteam handles both the electrical and software
      aspects of the bike. They design the camera and data acquisition system to
      improve the rider's safety and performance. There are no windows on the
      fairing, so the rider relies on this camera system to display the bikes
      surroundings and other information during the run. The systems consist of
      Raspberry Pis, microcontrollers, and a network of sensors. They also
      create custom software to record data from field testing, which later is
      used to review and analyse the performance of the bike.

  - name: Materials
    description:
      The primary purpose of the Materials subteam is to prototype and
      manufacture the fairing. This includes undergoing a design process to test
      and optimise the quality of the fairing to ensure the aerodynamic
      performance of the bike and rider safety. They also carry out extensive
      research to find the most viable methods and materials to produce the
      fairing. Currently, the fairing is fabricated using a resin infusion
      technique, which uses epoxy resin and carbon fibre. The Materials subteam
      uses power tools, applies surface finishing processes and creates
      composite components in order to produce the fairing.
