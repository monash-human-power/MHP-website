  - name: Aerodynamics
    description: The Aerodynamics subteam at MHP is chiefly responsible for the
      design and testing of the aerodynamic components of the bike, such as the
      external shell and wheel covers. The key purpose of the external shell
      (also referred to as the 'fairing') is to reduce drag on the bike. This
      means that it is designed to optimise the airflow to increase the maximum
      speed that the bike can reach. Through the use of computational fluid
      dynamics (CFD), as well as experimental testing in the Monash Wind Tunnel,
      the team is able to make aerodynamic design choices that can have a
      significant impact on the performance of the bike.

  - name: Chassis & Drive-train
    description: "The Chassis & Drive-train subteam is responsible for the design
      and manufacture of all mechanical components on the vehicle. This includes
      the structural frame (referred to as the chassis) and the moving parts of
      the vehicle. The design process involves modelling components through the
      use of CAD software and then verifying that they are capable of
      withstanding the relevant loading through testing on FEA software, or
      through hand calculations. The subteam utilises the resources available at
      Monash University to create the components, through manufacturing
      techniques such as welding, grinding, drilling and turning. "

  - name: Corporate
    description: "The Corporate subteam identify and engage the relevant external
      stakeholders to effectively facilitate the operations of MHP. This
      includes our flagship 'Build a HPV' school outreach program which promotes
      STEM and sustainable transport. They support the technical side by
      coordinating sponsorship, events, and marketing. "

    description: >
      The Electrical subteam handles both the electrical and software aspects of
      the bike. There are no windows on the fairing, so the rider relies on the
      camera system designed by the electrical subteam.

      They design the camera and data acquisition system to improve the rider's safety and performance. 

      The systems consist of Raspberry Pis, microcontrollers, and a network of sensors. They also create custom software to record data from field testing, which is used to review and analyse the performance of the bike.

  - name: Materials
    description: "The primary purpose of the Materials subteam is to prototype and
      manufacture the fairing. This includes undergoing a design process to test
      and optimise the quality of the fairing to ensure the aerodynamic
      performance of the bike and rider safety. The fairing is currently
      fabricated using the resin infusion technique which injects epoxy resin
      into carbon fibre while under a vacuum seal. Once the infusion process is
      complete, the carbon fibre is either painted or coated in clear lacquer
      and decals are applied. The Materials subteam uses power tools, applies
      surface finishing processes and creates composite components to produce
      the fairing. "

  - name: Rider Development
    description: The Rider Development subteam focuses on maximising rider output.
      Their tasks include cycling and strength training for the riders,
      competency training to ride the recumbent bikes, rider power plans for
      maximising speed, and physically testing the mechanical and electrical
      systems of the bike. The Rider Development subteam is also in charge of
      running event testing days at the Holden and Ford Proving Grounds.
