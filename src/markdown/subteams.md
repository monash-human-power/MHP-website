subteams:
  - name: aerodynamics
    description: The aerodynamics team at Monash Human Power is chiefly responsible
      for the design and testing of the aerodynamic components of our bike. The
      external shell (referred to as the 'fairing'), plays a huge role in
      allowing our bike to reach high speeds, and its design is one of our main
      focuses. Through the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as well as
      experimental testing in the Monash Wind Tunnel, the team is able to make
      aerodynamic design choices that can have a significant impact on the
      performance of our bike in the field.

  - name: corporate
    description: We are everything not that is not the bike in the engineering bike
      team. Doesn't make sense? Let's break it down. We identify and engage the
      relevant external stakeholders to bring efficiency and cohesion to MHP's
      operations and educate the public on HPV & sustainable transport. We do
      this in 3 intertwined streams sponsorship, events, and marketing. Whether
      it's making a good meme or liaising, we're here to support the technical
      side of the team however we can.

  - name: chassis & drive-train
    description: The Chassis & DT subteam are responsible for the design and
      manufacture of all mechanical components on the vehicle. This includes the
      frame or skeleton and the moving parts of the vehicle. The design process
      involves modelling components through the use of CAD software and then
      verifying that they are capable of withstanding the relevant loading
      through testing on FEA software, or through hand calculations. The
      sub-team will then utilise the resources available at the university to
      create the components, through manufacturing techniques such as welding,
      grinding, drilling and turning. Members will also have the opportunity to
      liaise with workshop experts for outsourced jobs that require complex
      machining.

  - name: electrical
    description: The Electrical sub-team handles both the electrical and software
      aspects of the bike. There are no windows on our fairing, so we rely on
      this sub-team to give the rider vision. They design the camera and data
      acquisition system to improve the rider's safety and performance. The
      systems consist of Raspberry Pi, microcontrollers, and a network of
      sensors. They also create custom software to view and analyse data from
      field testing and control different systems on the bike.

  - name: materials
    description: The primary purpose of the Materials sub-team is to prototype and
      manufacture the fairing of the human-powered bike. This includes
      undergoing a design process to test and optimise the quality of the
      fairing since it performs a very important role in improving the
      aerodynamics of the bike but is also imperative for the rider's safety.
      The fairing is fabricated using big-scale processes that evolve with each
      version of the bike so as to provide the members with an opportunity to
      develop their knowledge via an efficient material application.

  - name: rider development
    description: The Rider Development subteam focuses on all things relating to the
      rider. Their tasks include cycling and strength training for the riders,
      competency training to ride our recumbent bikes, rider power plans for
      maximising speed, physically testing the mechanical and electrical systems
      of the bike, and all projects relating to rider fit such as package space
      and negative fairing. The Rider Development subteam is also in charge of
      running event testing days at the Holden and Ford Proving Grounds.
