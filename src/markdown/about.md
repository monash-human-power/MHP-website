  - heading: Who We Are
    description: Monash Human Power is a student-led engineering team based at
      Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Since 2015 we have been
      designing, manufacturing, and racing fully-faired human-powered vehicles
      (HPV) to push the limits of human speed.

  - heading: Our Mission
    description: Our team’s vision is to make the fastest HPV in Australia, and
      eventually the world. We’re hoping to break the HPV land-speed record in
      Australia (currently 96.7km/h) having ridden at faster speeds during the
      2023 World Human Powered Speed Challenge, an international competition in
      the U.S. which we plan to return to in 2025. With support from Monash
      University and the Engineering faculty, we strive to provide a space where
      Monash students can develop valuable, real-world experience which they can
      carry on into their careers. Alongside our technical goals, we also aim to
      promote STEAM to the wider community within the framework of HPVs through
      school outreach programs.

    description: Monash Human Power is proud to offer a robust schools program that
      is tailored to the 'Science as a human endeavour' Level 9 and 10 Science
      achievement standards of the Victorian Curriculum. We hope to inspire a
      passion for STEM and sustainability in your students. We also run
      workshops for schools competing in the Victorian HPV Super Series.
